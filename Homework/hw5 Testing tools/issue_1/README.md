The code in the convert_morse implements doctests for the encode function, which translates English letters into Morse-code.
You should use on the command line to run the code:
```
python -m doctest -o NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE -v convert_morse.py
```
instead of 
```
python -m doctest convert_morse.py
```
for more correct operation of the program. View some test results in results.txt

Don't forget about using capital letters on your english message
